Hi there.

Trying my hand at writing more frequently, and publicly. Let's get to it.
* First things first
Some TODOs to carry out in the near(ish) future.
** TODO Set up a workflow that will make writing and publishing these posts easier.
- emacs keybinding to make new blog post - DONE
- auto publish to gitpages
- add keybinding to make new page, in other content/folders
** TODO Change out text on this page
Write a small bio? Some non-dev text, literally the whole point for this.
